# Teensy_Controller
USB based controller for the Teensy micro controller

A usb based game controller for a portable console that uses a Teensy as the main board. It supports up to 3 analog sticks (with autocalibration) and 32 buttons.

The analog code is based on [Sota's code from the Sudomod forums](http://www.sudomod.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=1766). It contains modified autocalibration code by Helder + wermy.
